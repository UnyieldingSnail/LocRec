Version: 1.0

This code is partially, recently cleaned. There are some unused methods because
they are used in some other classes which are not open. Please email to the
author if there is anything wrong.

Settings can be found in 'Config' file. There are some built-in parameters in
the programs.

The path 'data' provides some data exmaples.

Note that:
1. User ids and item ids in data must be encoded into continous integers
   and indexed from zero.

3. For ranking based model, 'ConvergeThreshold' should be set to be a very
   small value, such as 5e-15, in case of early-stop.

4. In ASMF and ARMF models, current version only supports Linear Aggregation
   algorithm to find potential check-ins from friends. If option '-AugRating'
   is specified, this specified file will be loaded for the potential
   check-ins, and it should include both potential check-ins and training
   check-ins together.
